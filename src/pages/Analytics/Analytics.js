                Analytics includes foundational capabilities and tools that
                generate powerful insights. Data management, data governance,
                and supporting architecture are age old problems that not only
                are critical building blocks for AI programs but are tactical
                concerns as organizations work in a dynamic and complex
                regulatory environment with mandates on data residency, privacy,
                and usage.
