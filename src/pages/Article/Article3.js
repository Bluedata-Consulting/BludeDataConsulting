                Businesses drive a country’s economy. They create millions of
                employment opportunities and support the livelihood of people
                all across the globe. It has been a crucial part of the overall
                development of a country and it’s people. Every day there are
                new ideas that take birth and very few of them manage to change
                and impact the lives of millions. There are many reasons behind
                this and the obvious one is lack of experience. Experience plays
                a vital role in an entrepreneurial journey. It enables
                professionals to better respond to challenges.

                When professionals run into a new challenge, the most important
                thing that they do is take the challenge positively, as a new
                learning experience. This is what Business Tycoons of this era
                call “the Winning attitude”. This attitude is what helps them to
                concur their demons and fight against tremendous odds to come
                out victorious in the other side.

                The first use of the term “coach” in connection with an
                instructor or trainer arose around 1830 in Oxford University
                slang for a tutor who “carried” a student through an exam.The
                word “coaching” thus identified a process used to transport
                people from where they are to where they want to be. The first
                use of the term in relation to sports came in 1861. Historically
                the development of coaching has been influenced by many fields
                of activity, including adult education, the Human Potential
                Movement, large-group awareness training (LGAT) groups such as
                “est”, leadership studies, personal development, and psychology.

                The concept of ADHD coaching was first introduced in 1994 by
                psychiatrists Edward M. Hallowell and John J. Ratey in their
                book Driven to Distraction.ADHD coaching is a specialized type
                of life coaching that uses specific techniques designed to
                assist individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity
                disorder. The goal of ADHD coaching is to mitigate the effects
                of executive function deficit, which is a typical impairment for
                people with ADHD. Coaches work with clients to help them better
                manage time, organize, set goals and complete projects. In
                addition to helping clients understand the impact ADHD has had
                on their lives, coaches can help clients develop “work-around”
                strategies to deal with specific challenges, and determine and
                use individual strengths. Coaches also help clients get a better
                grasp of what reasonable expectations are for them as
                individuals, since people with ADHD “brain wiring” often seem to
                need external mirrors for accurate self-awareness about their
                potential despite their impairment.

                Unlike psychologists or psychotherapists, ADHD coaches do not
                provide any therapy or treatment: their focus is only on daily
                functioning and behaviour aspects of the disorder.The ultimate
                goal of ADHD coaching is to help clients develop an “inner
                coach”, a set of self-regulation and reflective planning skills
                to deal with daily life challenges. A 2010 study from Wayne
                State University evaluated the effectiveness of ADHD coaching on
                110 students with ADHD. The research team concluded that the
                coaching “was highly effective in helping students improve
                executive functioning and related skills as measured by the
                Learning and Study Strategies Inventory (LASSI).”Yet, not every
                ADHD person needs a coach and not everyone can benefit from
                using a coach.

                Business coaching is a type of human resource development for
                business leaders. It provides positive support, feedback and
                advice on an individual or group basis to improve personal
                effectiveness in the business setting, many a time focusing on
                behavioural changes through psychometrics or 360-degree
                feedback. Business coaching is also called executive
                coaching,corporate coaching or leadership coaching. Coaches help
                their clients advance towards specific professional goals. These
                include career transition, interpersonal and professional
                communication, performance management, organizational
                effectiveness, managing career and personal changes, developing
                executive presence, enhancing strategic thinking, dealing
                effectively with conflict, and building an effective team within
                an organization. An industrial organizational psychologist is
                one example of executive coach. Business coaching is not
                restricted to external experts or providers. Many organizations
                expect their senior leaders and middle managers to coach their
                team members to reach higher levels of performance, increased
                job satisfaction, personal growth, and career development.
                Research studies suggest that executive coaching has a positive
                impact on workplace performance.
